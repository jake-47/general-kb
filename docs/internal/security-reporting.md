# Security Vulnerability Reporting Process

!!! warning "Internal Use Only"
    This documentation is for internal use only and should not be shared with external users.

This document outlines the process for reporting, tracking, and resolving security vulnerabilities in SiteTracker products and infrastructure.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Internal Discovery

If you discover a potential security vulnerability:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: Never share details about security vulnerabilities in public channels, forums, or issue trackers.

2. **Report Immediately**: Submit a report using the [Security Vulnerability Report Form](https://internal.sitetracker.com/security/report) or email security@sitetracker.com with the subject line "SECURITY VULNERABILITY REPORT".

3. **Include Required Information**:
   - Vulnerability description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Affected components or services
   - Any suggested mitigations
   - Your contact information

4. **Encryption**: For highly sensitive issues, use our [PGP key](https://security.sitetracker.com/pgp-key.txt) to encrypt your report.

### External Disclosure

If a security vulnerability is reported by an external researcher or customer:

1. **Acknowledge Receipt**: Respond within 24 hours to acknowledge receipt of the report.

2. **Log in Security Tracker**: Create a new entry in the [Security Vulnerability Tracker](https://security.sitetracker.com/tracker) with initial details.

3. **Assign Security Lead**: The Security Operations team will assign a Security Lead to coordinate the response.

4. **Communicate Timeline**: Provide the reporter with a timeline for investigation and next steps.

## Vulnerability Classification

All reported vulnerabilities are classified according to the following criteria:

| Severity | Description | Target Response Time | Target Resolution Time |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Critical** | Allows unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems with significant impact | 4 hours | 48 hours |
| **High** | Significant vulnerability with potential for data exposure or service disruption | 24 hours | 5 days |
| **Medium** | Limited impact vulnerability affecting non-critical systems | 48 hours | 15 days |
| **Low** | Minimal impact with limited or difficult exploitation | 72 hours | 30 days |

## Investigation Process

1. **Initial Assessment**: The Security Lead performs an initial assessment to validate and classify the vulnerability.

2. **Create Response Team**: For Critical or High severity issues, form a response team including:
   - Security Lead
   - Product Engineering representative
   - Infrastructure/DevOps representative
   - Communications representative (for customer-impacting issues)

3. **Technical Investigation**:
   - Reproduce the vulnerability in a secure environment
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess potential impact and exposure
   - Document affected systems and components

4. **Determine Containment Strategy**:
   - Develop immediate mitigation steps
   - Create a remediation plan
   - Establish testing criteria for the fix

## Remediation Process

1. **Develop Fix**:
   - Create and test patches or configuration changes
   - Document all changes thoroughly
   - Perform security review of proposed changes

2. **Deploy Fixes**:
   - Follow emergency deployment procedures for Critical/High vulnerabilities
   - Use standard deployment processes for Medium/Low vulnerabilities
   - Validate fixes in production environment

3. **Verification**:
   - Confirm the vulnerability is properly addressed
   - Perform regression testing
   - If reported externally, request verification from the reporter

## Disclosure Process

### Internal Disclosure

1. **Security Advisory**: Create an internal security advisory documenting:
   - Vulnerability details
   - Impact assessment
   - Mitigation steps
   - Root cause analysis

2. **Lessons Learned**: Conduct a post-incident review to identify process improvements.

### External Disclosure

For vulnerabilities that affect customers or require customer action:

1. **Draft Advisory**: Prepare an external security advisory including:
   - General description (without revealing exploitation details)
   - Affected versions
   - Upgrade/mitigation instructions
   - Acknowledgment of external reporter (if applicable)

2. **Approval Process**: Obtain approval from:
   - Security team
   - Legal team
   - Executive leadership

3. **Notification Channels**:
   - Security advisories portal
   - Email to affected customers
   - Release notes
   - If applicable, CVE submission

## Bug Bounty Program Management

SiteTracker maintains a private bug bounty program for invited security researchers:

1. **Triage Reports**: All submissions are triaged within 24 hours.

2. **Reward Determination**: Rewards are based on:
   - Severity of vulnerability
   - Quality of report
   - Potential impact
   - Novelty of the finding

3. **Researcher Communication**: Maintain clear and timely communication with researchers throughout the process.

4. **Program Maintenance**: Regularly review and update the bug bounty program scope, rules, and reward structure.

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Metrics Tracking**:
   - Time to acknowledgment
   - Time to resolution
   - Vulnerability categories
   - Source of discovery

2. **Quarterly Review**:
   - Review all vulnerabilities from the past quarter
   - Identify patterns and systemic issues
   - Update security testing and development practices

3. **Training Updates**:
   - Use sanitized vulnerability reports in security training
   - Update secure coding guidelines based on lessons learned
