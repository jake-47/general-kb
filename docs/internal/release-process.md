# Release Process

!!! warning "Internal Use Only"
    This documentation is for internal use only and should not be shared with external users.

This document outlines our release process, from planning to deployment.

## Release Cycle

We follow a monthly release cycle:

1. **Planning Phase** (Week 1)
   - Feature prioritization
   - Sprint planning
   - Roadmap updates

2. **Development Phase** (Weeks 2-3)
   - Feature implementation
   - Bug fixes
   - Documentation updates

3. **Stabilization Phase** (Week 4)
   - Feature freeze
   - QA testing
   - Performance testing
   - Release candidate creation

4. **Release Phase** (End of Week 4)
   - Final approval
   - Production deployment
   - Release announcement

## Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major version** (x.0.0): Incompatible API changes
- **Minor version** (0.x.0): New features in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch version** (0.0.x): Backward-compatible bug fixes

## Release Branches

The following branch strategy is used for releases:

- `trunk`: Main development branch
- `release/v1.x`: Long-lived branch for v1.x releases
- `release/v1.2.0`: Specific release branch
- `hotfix/v1.2.1`: Hotfix branch for urgent fixes

## Release Manager Responsibilities

Each release has a designated Release Manager who is responsible for:

1. Coordinating the release process
2. Maintaining the release schedule
3. Leading release meetings
4. Making go/no-go decisions
5. Approving hotfixes
6. Communicating release status
