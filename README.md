# General Purpose Knowledge Base Framework

## Project Overview
A powerful documentation platform that combines simplicity with advanced features, giving you complete control over how you present, secure, and distribute information.
What Makes This Different
This knowledge base framework is designed with a dual-purpose architecture that lets you maintain a single source of truth while serving different content to different audiences. It's perfect for organizations that need to maintain both public documentation and internal knowledge.

### Core Principles
**Single Source, Dual Output**: Maintain content in one repository while generating separate internal and external builds
**Privacy By Design**: Automatically filter internal-only content from public-facing documentation
**Docs-as-Code Workflow**: Use familiar Git workflows, branches, and pull requests to manage documentation
**Developer-Friendly**: Built on open standards with Markdown, Python, and JavaScript
**Future-Proof**: Version-controlled documentation with full history tracking and parallel version access

### Designed for Teams
This framework bridges the gap between technical and non-technical team members:
**For Writers**: Focus on content creation in Markdown without worrying about implementation details
**For Developers**: Integrate documentation directly into your development workflow with CI/CD support
**For Product Teams**: Link documentation to JIRA tickets to track documentation alongside features
**For IT Teams**: Secure deployment options for both public and private documentation needs

### Key Technical Features
**Robust Content Separation**: Built-in mechanisms for excluding sensitive information from public builds
**Modern UI**: Responsive design with light/dark mode, collapsible sections, and optimized navigation
**Enhanced Search**: Configurable search with Algolia integration option for enterprise-grade performance
**Quality Assurance**: Built-in tools for link validation, markdown linting, and documentation testing
**Deployment Flexibility**: Deploy to GitHub Pages, custom servers, or any static hosting service
**Enhanced Search Options**: Built-in search engine powered by Lunr.js that requires zero configuration or additional cost. Search interface is fully integrated with the theme and offers search highlighting, suggestions, and keyboard navigation. For extremely large documentation sites (~10,000 documents), the framework includes optional Algolia DocSearch integration, which requires additional setup and potentially introduces costs.

## Quick Start

### One-Time Setup (Only Needed When Creating Environment)
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- Node.js and npm (optional, for Markdown linting)

#### 1. Clone the repository
In your terminal, run

```
git clone https://github.com/jake-47/general-kb.git
cd general-kb
```

#### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows**: 
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-minify-plugin pymdown-extensions mike
```

#### 4. For macOS/Linux only: Make the build script executable 
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```

### Each Time You Work on the Documentation

#### 5. Activate the virtual environment

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
**On Windows**: 
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 6. Run the build script to serve or build the knowledge base locally

**For internal build**:
```bash
./build.sh internal site-external development serve 8000
```
**For external build**:
./build.sh external site development serve 8001

Open a new terminal to run both builds simultaneously.


### Writing rules

#### Internal-Only Content
To add internal-only content within pages, use the internal admonition:
markdownRegular content is visible to everyone by default.

!!! internal "Internal Only"
    This information is restricted to internal staff only.

#### OS-Specific Instructions
markdown=== "Windows"
    Windows-specific instructions go here

=== "macOS"
    macOS-specific instructions go here

=== "Linux"
    Linux-specific instructions go here

### Customization
The Knowledge Base is designed to be highly customizable:

Styling: Modify docs/assets/stylesheets/extra.css for custom CSS
JavaScript: Enhance functionality in docs/assets/javascripts/site-core.js and extra.js
Templates: Override theme components in docs/overrides/ directory
Config: Adjust site settings in mkdocs.yml and mkdocs.internal.yml

### Deploy to GitHub Pages (using mike for versioning)
mike deploy --push --update-aliases latest main
Custom Server Deployment
bash# Build the production site
./build.sh external site production build

### Copy the built site to your web server
rsync -avz --delete site/ user@server:/path/to/webroot/
Version Management
This project uses Mike for managing multiple versions of documentation:
bash# Deploy version 1.0.0 as "latest"
mike deploy 1.0.0 latest

### Set default version
mike set-default latest
