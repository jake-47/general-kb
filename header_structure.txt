Header Structure (Text Representation):

Knowledge Base Logo [LOGO] | Knowledge Base (Title) | [INTERNAL] | [Theme Toggle] | [Version: v3.5 â–¼]
                                                     ^
                                                     |
                               Only one internal indicator, correctly positioned

Based on HTML inspection:
1. The INTERNAL indicator appears exactly once in the header HTML
2. It's positioned before the theme toggle button as intended
3. The indicator has the proper classes: "md-header__environment env-internal"
4. The JavaScript that was creating a duplicate indicator has been disabled

The issue has been fixed by:
1. Disabling the JavaScript-based indicator creation in config-loader.js
2. Keeping only the template-based indicator in header.html
3. Preserving the code that removes "(Internal)" from page titles
4. Adding explanatory comments about why the change was made
